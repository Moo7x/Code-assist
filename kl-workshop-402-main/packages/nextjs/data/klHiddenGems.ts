    name: "Kwai Chai Hong",
    neighborhood: "Chinatown",
    description:
      "A restored back alley transformed into an open-air art gallery showcasing KL's Chinese heritage through stunning murals and installations. Once a forgotten laneway, it now tells stories of early Chinese immigrants through interactive street art.",
    localTip:
      "Visit at night when the neon lights come alive. The adjacent Kwai Chai Hong cafe serves excellent traditional kaya toast. Look for the hidden speakeasy bar PS150 nearby - ring the doorbell of what looks like an old toy shop.",

    name: "Thean Hou Temple Sunset Viewpoint",
    neighborhood: "Robson Heights",

      "While tourists flock here during Chinese New Year, locals know the real magic happens at sunset on regular days. This six-tiered Buddhist-Taoist temple offers panoramic city views and peaceful meditation spaces away from the crowds.",
    localTip:
      "Climb to the top floor for unobstructed sunset views. The temple is free to enter. On the 1st and 15th of each lunar month, witness authentic prayer ceremonies. The vegetarian restaurant inside serves surprisingly good mock meat dishes.",
    bestTime: "5 PM - 7 PM for sunset",
    emoji: "🛕",
  },
  {
    name: "Kampung Baru",
    neighborhood: "City Center",
    description:
      "A traditional Malay village frozen in time, surrounded by skyscrapers. Wooden stilt houses, fruit orchards, and authentic Malay culture exist just 10 minutes from KLCC. This is where KL's soul lives - unchanged since the 1900s.",
    localTip:
      "Join the Saturday night food market (Pasar Malam) for the best nasi lemak in the city at Nasi Lemak Antarabangsa. Walk through during Ramadan for an unforgettable bazaar experience. Dress modestly out of respect.",

    name: "Salak South Curry Laksa",
    neighborhood: "Salak South",
    description:
      "A nondescript coffee shop that serves what many locals consider the best curry laksa in all of KL. No signboard in English, no frills - just a plastic stool and a bowl of perfectly balanced coconut curry noodles that's been perfected over 40 years.",
    localTip:
      "Order 'laksa tambah mee' for extra noodles. Add the dried shrimp chili paste on the side - it's homemade. The cockles are fresh. Arrive before 11 AM or after 2 PM to avoid the queue. Cash only.",

    localTip:
      "Check their Instagram for weekend market schedules. The rooftop bar 'Shhhh' has craft cocktails with city views. Merchant's Lane cafe next door serves excellent brunch in a restored pre-war building. The basement occasionally hosts secret gigs.",

    neighborhood: "Taman Melawati",
    description:
      "A challenging quartzite ridge hike offering dramatic cliff-edge views of KL's skyline and the Klang Gates Dam. The white quartz formations look like dragon scales, giving this trail its mystical name. Not for the faint-hearted.",
    localTip:
      "Start at 6 AM to catch sunrise and avoid the heat. Bring at least 2 liters of water. The West trail is easier than East. A permit is technically required from Forestry Department but rarely checked on weekdays. Don't attempt after rain - the rocks become dangerously slippery.",
    bestTime: "6 AM - 9 AM on dry days",
    emoji: "🏔️",

  {
    name: "Taman Tugu",
    neighborhood: "Lake Gardens",

      "A newly restored 66-acre urban forest with elevated walkways through the canopy, just 15 minutes from the city center. Once an abandoned rubber estate, it's now home to rescued wildlife and 4,500 native trees. Most tourists don't know it exists.",
    localTip:
      "The 2.8km canopy walk is free but requires online registration. Early morning visitors often spot monitor lizards, long-tailed macaques, and various bird species. The Japanese Garden section is particularly peaceful. Pack mosquito repellent.",
    bestTime: "7 AM - 9 AM",
    emoji: "🌳",
  },
  {
    name: "Lorong Panggung Coffee Shops",
    neighborhood: "Chinatown",
    description:
      "A hidden alley of traditional Chinese coffee shops serving the same recipes for 70+ years. No air conditioning, marble-top tables, and kopitiam uncle pouring teh tarik from impossible heights. This is old KL at its most authentic.",
    localTip:
      "Try 'Kopi Gu You' (butter coffee) at Nam Chau - it's their secret recipe. The charcoal-toasted bread with homemade kaya is unmissable. Point at what others are eating if the menu confuses you. Most close by 5 PM.",
    bestTime: "7 AM - 11 AM for breakfast crowd",
    emoji: "☕",
